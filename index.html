      <h1>🐷 Pig Game - rules</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
        the player decides to "hold": <br /><br />
        ◾If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
        player's turn.<br /><br />
        ◾If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total
        and the player's turn continues. <br /><br />
        ◾If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
        score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score
        100 or more points wins.<br /><br />
        For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5.
        Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald
        rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to
        roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The
        next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she
        chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
